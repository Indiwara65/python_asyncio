    "        * Core that manages executing asncronous tasks, the event loop runs in a single thread and contonously checks for tasks that are ready to be executed.          \n",
    "        * The event loop schedules and manages the execution of multiple coroutines. When a coroutine encounters an await expression (usually an I/O operation), the event loop pauses its execution and moves on to the next task, resuming the original coroutine once the awaited operation is complete.                       \n",
    "    * Asyncronous Tasks - asyncronous tasks are operations or pieces of code that can run concurrently. Asyncronous tasks include couroutines, futures, callbacks, etc..          \n",
    "    * Running Asyncronous Tasks - there are different methods that can be used to run the asyncronous tasks. "
